# What is this?
Woof OS. A simple Linux distribution built on top of Arch to provide a fast, bleeding-edge, powerful system to the user. It comes with pre-customized standalone window managers rather than desktop environments and light weight applications, so it is super fast but it also might be hard for new users.

# Features
## Includes Chaotic AUR
Chaotic AUR has binaries of popular AUR packages, that provides pre-compiled binaries to be installed rather than building packages (some) from the AUR.

## Beautiful
The config files are updated very often and we try to make the best looking desktop that is functional.

## Beginner Friendly (Coming Soon)
We are working on a Plasma edition so that new users can benifit from our features as well, just as our current config, we expect to update it very often.
